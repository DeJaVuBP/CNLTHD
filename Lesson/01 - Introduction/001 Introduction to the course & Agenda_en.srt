00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to the Master Microservices course with the help of Spring Boot, Docker and Kubernetes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This course helps Java developers to build production grade microservices by using Spring Boot, Docker,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Kubernetes and other supporting components.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here you may have a question like Why should I learn microservices?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The reason why you should learn and master microservices is these days many organizations, they are

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
migrating their monolithic applications into microservices.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The reason is microservices architecture makes applications easier to scale, faster to develop, enable

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
innovation, and it is also going to help organizations by accelerating the time to take their new enhancements

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to the market.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So with all these reasons, microservice is going to be a demanding skill set for next few years.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So to help you mastering microservices, this course has been built.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let me try to quickly cover what is the agenda of this course, what exactly I'm going to cover throughout

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
this course.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
First, we are going to start the course by entering into the world of microservices.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to give a formal introduction about what is microservices, how they are different from monolithic

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and server architectures.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Once we are clear about the microservices architecture, why we should build microservices, I'm going

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to explain you how to build a microservices with the help of Spring Boot by following the production

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
standards.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
These standards includes best practices while building rest APIs, how to document your Rest APIs,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
how to perform validations on top of your rest APIs, all these standards and best practices we are

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
going to discuss while building microservices throughout this course. And apart from building microservices,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm also going to teach you how to rightsize your microservices, how to identify boundaries and how

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to containerize your microservices with the help of Docker.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Because without knowing on how to containerize your spring boot application, you cannot really build

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
microservices.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's why learning about Docker is very basic need for a microservice developer.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So once we learn about how to containerize our microservices, I'm going to explain you how to maintain

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
configurations inside your microservices with the help of spring cloud config server, followed by how

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to build your own service discovery and service registration inside microservices using Eureka Server

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and how to build an edge server or an entry point into your microservice network with the help of Spring

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Cloud Gateway.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And apart from building your microservices, you should also take care of making your microservices

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
resilient and fault tolerant by using standards like resiliency4j  patterns.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So these patterns are also discussed throughout this course in detail.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once building microservices is completed, you should also take care of how to implement observability

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and monitoring inside your microservices by using supporting components like Grafana, Prometheus.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So all these components we are going to explore and we are going to implement observability and monitoring

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
inside our microservices. And we can't climb our microservices as production ready without securing our

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
microservices.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's why we are also going to put good amount of efforts in understanding how to secure our microservices.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Using Oauth2, OpenID, Spring Security Frameworks.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And sometimes you may also want to build some microservices which can process the requests asynchronously.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So to handle such scenarios, I'm going to explain you how to build event driven microservices with

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the help of Rabbitmq, Spring cloud functions and spring cloud stream.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Very similarly, we are also going to explore how to build event driven microservices with the help

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
of Kafka as well.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And at last we are also going to learn on how to deploy all our containers into a Kubernetes cluster.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So Kubernetes cluster is an container orchestration product.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
At the end of the day, all our microservice has to be deployed into a Kubernetes cluster.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's why we are also going to focus on learning about Kubernetes, how to deploy your microservices

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
into your Kubernetes cluster.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And once we are clear about Kubernetes, we are also going to learn about Helm, which is a Kubernetes

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
package manager.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Once we are clear about Helm, we are also going to deploy our microservices into one of the cloud environment.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So by logging into your cloud environment, we are going to create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy all

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
our microservices into cloud environment.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Apart from all these components, we are going to learn many best practices, techniques that are followed

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
by the real time microservice developers.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So with all these agenda, this course is going to help you to master microservices and clear any interviews.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Apart from these course agenda

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I also want to highlight that entire course is built using easily understandable format.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Any complex topic you will be

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
able to easily understand with a beautiful visuals that we are going to discuss throughout this course.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All these visuals is going to help you to easily digest any kind of complex topic.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I'm also going to share you all this content in an PDF format for your reference. So that in future,

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
whenever you have some questions, you can always refer these PDF for any questions and quickly refresh

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
your microservices skills.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This pdf I'm going to share is also going to help you to save some time from taking notes.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So with this, it should be pretty clear for you that I have put good amount of efforts to build this

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
information in an easily understandable format.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I also want to clarify you that throughout this course, apart from theory discussions, apart from

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
discussing about various concepts and best practices, we are also going to build good amount of microservices

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and there are enough hands on discussions that we are going to make throughout this course and in the

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
same process we are going to explore many, many best practices, standards, products, tools that

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
are going to make our life easy while building production ready.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Microservices, I hope this is clear to you, so please go ahead and enroll into this course without

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
any questions and we are together is going to enjoy this microservice journey.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I'm hoping you to see in the next lecture bye.
