Inside this lecture.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me try to provide a formal definition of microservice so that if someone asks you, you should be

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
able to answer it quickly and easily.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You don't have to explain all the concepts that we discussed previously to a non-technical person.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So if some business user or if some client asks you what is the definition of microservice or what are

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
microservice, then you can tell this definition.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And this definition is defined by the James Lewis and Martin Fowler's in one of the blog article that

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
they have written.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So like you can see, microservices is an approach to develop a single application as a suit of small

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
services inside easy bank web application, we can develop a web application as a suit of small services

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
with the name accounts, loans and cards.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And each of these services, they can run in their own process and they can communicate with lightweight

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
mechanisms like rest and all these microservices built around business capabilities or business domains.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And most importantly, they can independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We can automate everything like as soon as a developer check in into the code base of a microservice,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the build will happen and the same build will be deployed automatically into dev and uat environment.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And if needed, we can also automate the deployment into production using CI/CD concept.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So there are many, many advantages with microservice which we are going to learn inside this course.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But on a high level this is going to be your simple go to definition of microservice.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I hope this is helpful to you, especially when you're talking with non-technical persons.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then please use this definition.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you and I'll catch you in the next lecture bye.
